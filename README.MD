## Project 
Auto Odo is a mobile application that aims to allow the user to easily be informed of the total amount of distance they have traveled for work during a particular day, week or month. The distance will be recorded in miles as the user inputs the values.

---
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to make it easier for users to track their work miles through a click of a button and provide them the necessary information they need, which they can use to increase their tax savings, as work miles are tax-deductible.

---
## Additional Features 
In addition, though uncertain as of now, the application may integrate google maps in order to specifically show the user the routes they have traveled that the app has tracked.

It allows users to view all their inputs, as well as delete them if the user needs to do so.
